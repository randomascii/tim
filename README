tim
---

A silly little tool to time how long it takes to run a command. Similar to
"time" in bash, etc. but it can't be called "time" because the Windows shell
reserves that for the most useless utility ever.


Build
-----

From a vsvars32.bat shell (i.e. with compiler in the path):

  C:\...\tim>m.bat


Example
-------

  c:\src\proj>tim some.exe -with arguments
  some.exe: blah blorp
  some.exe: wee waa

  peak memory: 8.22MB
  real: 0m3.953s
  qpc: 3940596us

Meaning it took just under 4 seconds to run some.exe and one of the child
processes in the process tree used a peak of 8.22 MB of commit. tim has no
command line arguments, everything after its name is the subcommand.

An identical copy of tim.exe is made as timavg.exe. If 'timavg' is used in place
of 'tim', the subcommand is run 7 times and the average is reported, discarding
fastest and slowest.
